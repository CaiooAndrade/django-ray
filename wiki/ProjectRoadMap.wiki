= Introduction =

This will serve as a general plan for developers wishing to join in or already working on the project.

|| *2.+* || On site template block editing ? ||

= 0.2 = 

In this version the focus will be to make the file browser secure and usable. It must also provide a clear and stable API and events to other plugins (ex; file open, rename, move, etc..).

= 0.3 = 

At this point the code editor should be stable. All features that does not feel rock solid will be removed until they do.

= 0.4 = 

The workspace should be fully functional and stable with standards features like split buffers, buffer resize, etc..

= 0.5 = 

A configuration panel will be introduced to hold editor's fine grained options .. I'm thinking about something like Firefox's _about:config_ .. sounds good ?

= 0.6 =

At this point some more "sugar" feature can be added to the editor.

= 0.7 =

SVN integration .. or Ronny Pfannschmidt suggested using *anyvc* to abstract multiple VCS .. it almost seems to good to be true so we'll have to take a look at it: http://bitbucket.org/RonnyPfannschmidt/anyvc/

= 0.8 =

Support for diff (using split buffers)

= 0.9 =

By this point I hopefully will have enough time to code a syntax parser/tokenizer for Django's template syntax or will have found find someone smart enough to do it.

= 1.0 =

Finally we have a full fledged & integrated Django editor :) Next version until 2.0 are only bug fixing, code refactoring/cleanup and minor feature additions.

= 2.0 =

Who knows..
